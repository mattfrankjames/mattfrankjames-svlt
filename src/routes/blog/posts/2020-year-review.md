I could start this post the same as I did my 2019 year in review. Basically, 2019 was a shit year. I left a job I loved for a false bill of goods at an eCommerce company. My dad passed away and I let my mental and physical health spiral. Heading into this year, I had resolved to turn things around, but, as we have all experienced at this point, the year had other plans.

I could start this post the same as I did my 2019 year in review. Basically, [2019 was a shit year]('./2019-year-review'). I left a job I loved for a false bill of goods at an eCommerce company. My dad passed away and I let my mental and physical health spiral. Heading into this year, I had resolved to turn things around, but, as we have all experienced at this point, the year had other plans.

Things started out well. I completed dry January and spent every day either on the treadmill or on my rollers. I was losing weight, taking control of my overall health and feeling better than I had in years.

Professionally, I took an interview with a software development company as a lark toward the end of 2019, not thinking much about it until they called me in for a second interview with the entire product team a month later. The interview went well, but I was having a blast building out a headless PWA for the eCommerce company with Next.js and Magento, largely in charge of the entire front-end stack. I felt that if I could bank that project on my resume, I'd probably be able to get almost any job I'd want so had largely decided to pass if offered a role at the software company.

## A new start

In one of the few truly positive chain of events this year has offered, my PWA project was abruptly cancelled and I started being shuffled toward project management for content publishing, which was leagues removed from what I had signed up for. In a serendipitous turn of fortune, I got an offer from the software company that same day. Everything largely aligned to make the decision for me and I gave notice the next day.

My first week as a 'senior front-end software engineer' was wonderful and it was immediately clear that both the environment, team and scope of deeply challenging work was exactly what I wanted from my career. I started on the second of March and felt immediately welcomed.

Then, six days after I started, the gravity of the COVID crisis became undeniable and the company decided that we would be working from home for the foreseeable future.

## Into the deep end, from home

The transition to full-time work from home coincided with the transition to remote learning for my kids. Their school has to make up both an approach and a curriculum overnight and it showed. I am deeply grateful for the effort they put in, but it meant that a huge amount of schooling responsibility went to us, the parents and this came right at the time I was onboarding with my new job.

To say this was a challenge is an understatement. Our platform is immense and built on Ember. While I am a fan of the modern Ember approach, the older versions, commonly referred to as 'Ember Classic' are highly bespoke, difficult to read and generally confusing from an architectural perspective. Trying to get a handle on that while making sure my kids did what they needed to do without melting down all while watching the world fall apart with paralyzing uncertainty had me falling back on all the health progress I had made at the start of the year.

There are many on Twitter who have proclaimed this forced transition to primarily remote work as a gift and a paradigm shift for companies moving forward.

I don't see it that way. I work better in an office where I can focus and feed off the energy of my team during an impromptu collaboration. At home, my office has no door, so the kids are schooling ten feet away where I can hear each one of their distractions or meltdowns or disappointments when they don't get picked to partner up in a Zoom breakout room. Knowing that my wife is left to navigate that while I try and focus just adds to the challenges of our 'new normal'. My company has a very generous PTO/flexible schedule policy, but it's hard to feel good taking advantage of that when you're the new one on the team.

## A season of un-rest

In the summer, outrage of a seemingly ceaseless string of killings of black people at the hands of law-enforcement sparked what seemed like a reckoning with the history of race in our country. As a middle age white man with a white family in largely white suburbs, I had hoped to help guide some positive conversations with my kids. We recounted recent events to them, talked about the history of race and its injustice in our country and took them to a local march. While I'm happy that we are having these conversations with them, this year has made it clear that it's not enough and that we have sheltered them from the realities of the world for too long. While I can never have a true understanding of the challenges our society throws at marginalized people, I can work to make sure that my kids have the resources to make a positive impact in this area.

## A changing direction

For the last four years, our country has been led by a callous ego maniac more focused on sewing division and buring everything to the ground in the pursuit of personal profit than in meeting the challenges that we face as a nation. This year, we had a chance to right that wrong and elect a new president. Thankfully, in one of the few positive takeaways from this year, grassroots organizing worked and we
